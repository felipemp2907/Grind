## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Run Database Setup Script

**CRITICAL:** You must run the database setup script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `scripts/database-setup-comprehensive.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the script

This script will:
- Create all required tables (profiles, goals, tasks)
- Set up proper indexes and constraints
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Create helper functions for user management
- Add a health check function

### Step 2: Verify Setup

After running the SQL script, you can verify everything is working:

1. **Check API Health:**
   - Visit: `https://your-api-url/api/health`
   - Should show: `"goals.createUltimate"` in the procedures list

2. **Check Database Health:**
   - Visit: `https://your-api-url/api/db-health`
   - Should return: `{"status": "healthy", "ok": true}`

3. **Test Goal Creation:**
   - Try creating a new Ultimate Goal in the app
   - Should work without 404 or "Database not set up" errors

## Technical Changes Made

### Backend Changes:
- **`backend/trpc/create-context.ts`**: Added database health checks and automatic user profile creation
- **`backend/hono.ts`**: Added `/health` and `/db-health` endpoints
- **`backend/trpc/routes/goals/create-ultimate-goal.ts`**: Fixed import paths
- **`scripts/database-setup-comprehensive.sql`**: Complete database setup script

### Frontend Changes:
- **`app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`**: Fixed React key warning

### Key Features Added:
1. **Automatic Database Health Checking**: Every tRPC request now verifies database is ready
2. **Comprehensive Error Messages**: Clear instructions when database setup is needed
3. **Development Mode Support**: Automatic demo user creation for development
4. **Health Check Endpoints**: Easy verification of API and database status

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Goal Creation**: Should work immediately without any 404 errors
2. **Task Generation**: Full automatic task planning should work for new goals
3. **Database Operations**: All CRUD operations should work properly
4. **Development Mode**: Demo user automatically created and used when no auth token

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors after running the SQL script:

1. **Check Supabase Logs**: Look for any SQL execution errors
2. **Verify Tables**: Ensure `profiles`, `goals`, and `tasks` tables exist
3. **Check RLS Policies**: Ensure Row Level Security policies are active
4. **Test Health Endpoints**: Use the `/health` and `/db-health` endpoints to diagnose

## Next Steps

Once the database setup is complete:
1. The app should work normally for goal creation
2. Streak tasks and today tasks will be automatically generated
3. All tRPC endpoints should be accessible
4. Database operations should work without "Database not set up" errors

The system is now properly configured for the full automatic task planning system as requested in your previous messages.
