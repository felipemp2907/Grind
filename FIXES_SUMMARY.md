# Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve the reported errors.

## ðŸ”§ Database Foreign Key Constraint Fixes

### Problem
- Goals and tasks tables were referencing `auth.users(id)` directly
- This caused foreign key constraint violations because user profiles weren't being created properly
- The `completed` column was missing from the tasks table schema cache

### Solution
1. **Updated database schema** (`database-setup.sql`):
   - Changed all foreign key references from `auth.users(id)` to `public.profiles(id)`
   - Added proper cascade relationships
   - Added comprehensive table dropping and recreation to avoid conflicts

2. **Tables affected**:
   - `goals.user_id` now references `public.profiles(id)`
   - `tasks.user_id` now references `public.profiles(id)`
   - `journal_entries.user_id` now references `public.profiles(id)`

3. **Added verification script** (`scripts/test-database.sql`):
   - Tests all foreign key relationships
   - Verifies table creation
   - Checks RLS policies and functions

## ðŸ”§ TypeScript and Import Fixes

### Problem
- Import errors for `authStore` in other stores
- Missing `addXp` method type annotation
- Missing type exports in `types/index.ts`

### Solution
1. **Fixed import paths**:
   - Changed `@/store/authStore` to `./authStore` in `goalStore.ts` and `taskStore.ts`

2. **Added proper type annotations**:
   - Fixed `addXp: (amount: number) => Promise<void>` in `userStore.ts`
   - Added proper parameter typing for the `amount` parameter

3. **Method call fixes**:
   - Fixed `addXP` to `addXp` in `focus-mode.tsx`
   - Made `addXp` call non-blocking in `taskStore.ts`

## ðŸ”§ Database Setup Improvements

### Problem
- Database setup was fragile and prone to foreign key conflicts
- No verification mechanism to ensure setup worked correctly

### Solution
1. **Enhanced setup script**:
   - Added table dropping at the beginning to avoid conflicts
   - Added comprehensive verification at the end
   - Added test profile and goal creation to verify foreign keys work

2. **Created documentation**:
   - `DATABASE_SETUP.md` with step-by-step instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - Schema overview and relationship explanations

3. **Added test scripts**:
   - `scripts/test-database.sql` for manual verification
   - `__tests__/database-setup.test.js` for automated testing

## ðŸ”§ Monochrome Theme Implementation

### Problem
- Request to replace purple accents with black-and-white palette
- Maintain functional colors for success/warning states

### Solution
1. **Updated color constants** (`constants/colors.ts`):
   - Changed `primary` from `#6C5CE7` to `#FFFFFF`
   - Changed `secondary` from `#00CECE` to `#FFFFFF`
   - Kept `success` as `#38D9A9` (functional green)
   - Kept `warning` as `#FFB400` (functional amber)

2. **Added theme tests** (`__tests__/theme-smoke.test.js`):
   - Verifies monochrome palette implementation
   - Checks accessibility and contrast
   - Ensures no purple colors remain

## ðŸ“‹ Files Modified

### Database Files
- `database-setup.sql` - Complete rewrite with proper foreign keys
- `scripts/test-database.sql` - New verification script
- `DATABASE_SETUP.md` - New setup documentation

### Store Files
- `store/userStore.ts` - Fixed type annotations and method signatures
- `store/goalStore.ts` - Fixed import paths
- `store/taskStore.ts` - Fixed import paths and method calls

### App Files
- `app/focus-mode.tsx` - Fixed method name from `addXP` to `addXp`

### Theme Files
- `constants/colors.ts` - Implemented monochrome palette

### Test Files
- `__tests__/database-setup.test.js` - New database tests
- `__tests__/theme-smoke.test.js` - New theme tests
- `FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Run the database setup**:
   - Copy `database-setup.sql` into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Execute the complete script
   - Verify with `scripts/test-database.sql`

2. **Test the application**:
   - Create a new goal (should work without foreign key errors)
   - Create tasks (should work without schema cache errors)
   - Complete tasks (should award XP properly)

3. **Verify theme changes**:
   - Check that buttons and accents are now white/monochrome
   - Ensure success/warning colors are still functional
   - Verify accessibility and contrast

## âœ… Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- âœ… No more foreign key constraint violations when creating goals
- âœ… No more "column not found" errors when creating tasks
- âœ… No more TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… Proper monochrome theme with functional accent colors
- âœ… Comprehensive database setup with verification
- âœ… Better error handling and debugging capabilities

All reported errors should be resolved, and the application should function properly with the new monochrome design.
