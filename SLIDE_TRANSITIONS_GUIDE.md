# Slide-Across Transitions for Bottom Tab Navigator

This guide explains how to implement smooth slide-across transitions for your Expo Router bottom tab navigator using React Native Reanimated.

## ✅ Implementation Status

The slide transitions have been successfully implemented with the following features:

### 🎯 What's Been Added

1. **React Native Reanimated Integration**
   - ✅ Installed `react-native-reanimated`
   - ✅ Added proper imports to `app/_layout.tsx`
   - ✅ Enhanced tab layout with performance optimizations

2. **AnimatedTabScreen Component**
   - ✅ Created `components/AnimatedTabScreen.tsx`
   - ✅ Smooth slide-in animations with scale and opacity effects
   - ✅ Web compatibility (animations disabled on web to prevent issues)
   - ✅ Platform-specific optimizations

3. **Tab Layout Enhancements**
   - ✅ Optimized tab icons with `useMemo` for performance
   - ✅ Enhanced tab bar styling with proper safe area handling
   - ✅ Native slide animations enabled for iOS/Android

4. **Example Implementation**
   - ✅ Home screen (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) wrapped with AnimatedTabScreen

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Wrap Your Tab Screens

To add slide animations to any tab screen, simply wrap the content with `AnimatedTabScreen`:

```tsx
import AnimatedTabScreen from '@/components/AnimatedTabScreen';

export default function YourTabScreen() {
  return (
    <AnimatedTabScreen index={0}> {/* index is optional */}
      <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
        {/* Your screen content */}
      </SafeAreaView>
    </AnimatedTabScreen>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Apply to All Tab Screens

For consistent animations across all tabs, wrap each tab screen:

- ✅ `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (Home) - Already implemented
- ⏳ `app/(tabs)/tasks.tsx` (Tasks)
- ⏳ `app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx` (Calendar)
- ⏳ `app/(tabs)/journal.tsx` (Journal)
- ⏳ `app/(tabs)/coach.tsx` (AI Coach)
- ⏳ `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` (Settings)

## 🎨 Animation Features

### Native Platforms (iOS/Android)
- **Slide Animation**: Screens slide in from right to left
- **Scale Effect**: Subtle scale animation (0.95 → 1.0) for depth
- **Opacity Fade**: Smooth opacity transition (0 → 1)
- **Duration**: 300ms for slide, 250ms for opacity
- **Easing**: Cubic easing for slide, quad for opacity, back easing for scale

### Web Platform
- **Fallback**: No animations to prevent compatibility issues
- **Instant Display**: Immediate content rendering
- **Performance**: Zero animation overhead

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Animation Timing
```tsx
// In AnimatedTabScreen.tsx, modify these values:
const SLIDE_DURATION = 300;
const OPACITY_DURATION = 250;
const SCALE_DURATION = 300;
```

### Animation Direction
```tsx
// Change initial translateX value for different directions:
const translateX = useSharedValue(SCREEN_WIDTH); // Right to left (current)
const translateX = useSharedValue(-SCREEN_WIDTH); // Left to right
```

### Easing Functions
```tsx
// Available easing options:
Easing.out(Easing.cubic)    // Current slide easing
Easing.out(Easing.quad)     // Current opacity easing
Easing.out(Easing.back(1.1)) // Current scale easing
```

## 📱 Performance Optimizations

### Tab Layout Optimizations
- **Memoized Icons**: Tab icons are memoized to prevent re-renders
- **Optimized Styles**: Literal style values for better performance
- **Platform Checks**: Animations only run on supported platforms

### Memory Management
- **Cleanup**: Proper animation cleanup on screen unmount
- **Conditional Rendering**: Web fallback prevents unnecessary calculations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Animations Not Working**
   - Ensure `react-native-reanimated` is properly installed
   - Check that gesture handler imports are at the top of `_layout.tsx`
   - Verify platform is not web (animations are disabled on web)

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Use `useMemo` for heavy computations in tab screens
   - Avoid complex animations in child components
   - Consider lazy loading for heavy screens

3. **Layout Issues**
   - Ensure SafeAreaView is inside AnimatedTabScreen, not outside
   - Check that container styles have `flex: 1`

### Debug Mode
Add this to see animation values:
```tsx
// In AnimatedTabScreen.tsx
console.log('Animation values:', {
  translateX: translateX.value,
  opacity: opacity.value,
  scale: scale.value
});
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Apply to Remaining Screens**: Wrap all other tab screens with AnimatedTabScreen
2. **Test on Device**: Verify animations work smoothly on physical devices
3. **Fine-tune Timing**: Adjust animation durations based on user feedback
4. **Add Gesture Support**: Consider adding swipe gestures for tab switching
