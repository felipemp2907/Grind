Examples:

- "Add reading as a daily habit" â†’ create action with isHabit: true
- "Schedule a call with John next Tuesday at 2 PM" â†’ create action

Date parsing rules:

- "tonight" = current date with evening time
- "next week" = current date + 7 days
- "Monday", "Tuesday", etc. = next occurrence of that day

- "2 PM", "2:00 PM", "14:00" â†’ "14:00"

- "morning" â†’ "09:00"
- "afternoon" â†’ "14:00"
- "evening" â†’ "18:00"

Task type detection:
- Words like "daily", "every day", "habit", "routine" â†’ isHabit: true
- Specific one-time activities â†’ isHabit: false

XP Value assignment:
- Simple tasks (5-15 min): 20-25 XP
- Medium tasks (30-60 min): 30-40 XP  
- Complex tasks (1+ hours): 45-50 XP
