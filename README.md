- **Enhanced Contrast**: Improved readability with refined background and text colors
- **Modern Aesthetic**: Minimalist design inspired by iOS, Instagram, and Linear

### ðŸŽ¯ Focus Mode & Task Generation Improvements

**Fixed Issues:**
1. **Focus Mode Shortcut** - Added missing entry tile on Home tab that appears when tasks are in progress
2. **Profile Editor** - Fixed save functionality using upsert instead of update, added success/error toasts
3. **Task Generator** - Implemented Goal-Clarification Flow to reduce overwhelm and duplicates

**New Features:**

**Technical Improvements:**

- Toast notifications for better user feedback
- Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

## Setup

### Database Setup (Required)

Before using Grind, you need to set up the database tables in your Supabase project:

1. **Copy the SQL script**: The app will show you a database setup prompt with a "Copy SQL Script" button
2. **Open Supabase Dashboard**: Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) and select your project
3. **Navigate to SQL Editor**: Find "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. **Run the script**: Paste the SQL and click "Run" to create all tables and policies
5. **Verify setup**: Return to the app and tap "Check Setup" to continue

The setup creates:
- User profiles and authentication
- Goals and milestones tracking  
- Tasks and habit management
- Journal entries storage
- Secure data access policies

### Development

Run Edge deploy, then sign in to test Focus shortcut and new features.
