# tRPC Goal Creation Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. tRPC Client Configuration Issue
**Problem**: The transformer was incorrectly placed at the root level of the tRPC client configuration, causing TypeScript errors.

**Fix**: Moved the `transformer: superjson` inside the `httpBatchLink` configuration where it belongs.

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/trpc.ts` - Fixed transformer placement

### 2. Database Schema Mismatch
**Problem**: The tRPC procedures were trying to insert into database columns that don't exist in the current schema (`category`, `target_value`, `unit`, `priority`, `color`, `cover_image`, `status`, `type`, `task_date`).

**Fix**: 
- Created a database migration script to add missing columns
- Updated tRPC procedures to handle missing columns gracefully
- Updated goalStore fallback to use safe column insertion

**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/fix-goals-table-missing-columns.sql` - Database migration script
- `backend/trpc/routes/goals/create-ultimate-goal.ts` - Safe column insertion
- `store/goalStore.ts` - Safe fallback insertion

### 3. JSON Parse Error Prevention
**Problem**: The client was receiving HTML responses instead of JSON when the API wasn't working properly.

**Fix**: Enhanced error handling in the tRPC client to detect HTML responses and provide better error messages.

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/trpc.ts` - Enhanced error detection and logging

## Required Actions

### 1. Run Database Migration
Execute the following SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of scripts/fix-goals-table-missing-columns.sql
```

This will add the missing columns to your `goals` and `tasks` tables.

### 2. Verify API Server is Running
Make sure your backend server is running and accessible. The tRPC client will now provide better error messages if the server is not reachable.

### 3. Test Goal Creation
After running the migration, test creating an ultimate goal. The app should now:
- Successfully create goals via tRPC
- Fall back to direct Supabase insertion if tRPC fails
- Provide clear error messages instead of cryptic JSON parse errors

## Error Handling Improvements

The fix includes multiple layers of error handling:

1. **tRPC Level**: Proper error responses with JSON format
2. **Client Level**: Detection of HTML responses vs JSON
3. **Fallback Level**: Direct Supabase insertion if tRPC fails
4. **Database Level**: Safe column insertion that won't fail on missing columns

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Try creating an ultimate goal through the app
2. Check the console logs for detailed error information if issues occur
3. Verify that goals are created in the database with the new columns
4. Test both tRPC and fallback paths

## Files Modified

- `lib/trpc.ts` - Fixed transformer configuration and enhanced error handling
- `backend/trpc/routes/goals/create-ultimate-goal.ts` - Safe database insertion
- `store/goalStore.ts` - Safe fallback insertion
- `scripts/fix-goals-table-missing-columns.sql` - Database migration (new file)

The fix ensures that goal creation will work regardless of whether the database has been fully migrated or not, providing a robust solution that handles various edge cases.
