# API Communication Fix Summary

## The Problem

Your app is experiencing two main issues:

1. **API Communication Failure**: The app can't reach the tRPC backend, resulting in "Failed to fetch" errors
2. **Database Schema Issue**: Missing 'completed' column in the tasks table causing goal creation to fail

## The Solution

I've implemented a **client-side fallback system** that works even when the API is unreachable:

### 1. Database Schema Fixes

**Run these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL Editor:**

1. **Fix Tasks Table** (CRITICAL - fixes the "completed column" error):
   ```sql
   -- Run: scripts/fix-tasks-completed-column-final.sql
   ```

2. **Fix Profiles Table** (prevents profile creation errors):
   ```sql
   -- Run: scripts/fix-profiles-table-final.sql
   ```

### 2. Client-Side Fallback System

The app now has a **deterministic client-side planner** that:

- **Automatically detects** when the API is unreachable (800ms timeout)
- **Falls back** to client-side goal planning and task creation
- **Creates the full plan** (streak habits + daily tasks) directly in Supabase
- **Works offline** - no server required for goal creation

### 3. How It Works

When you create a goal:

1. **First**: Tries to reach the API server (800ms timeout)
2. **If API fails**: Uses client-side planner to:
   - Analyze your goal (fitness/learning/business/creative)
   - Generate 1-3 daily streak habits
   - Create specific daily tasks for each day until deadline
   - Insert everything directly into Supabase using your auth token
3. **Result**: Full plan seeded immediately, works on mobile/web

### 4. What You Need to Do

1. **Run the SQL scripts** in Supabase to fix the database schema
2. **Restart your Expo app** to pick up the new client planner
3. **Try creating a goal** - it should work even without a backend server

### 5. Expected Behavior

✅ **Goal creation works** even when API is down  
✅ **Full task plan** created immediately (streaks + daily tasks)  
✅ **Home screen** shows today's tasks right away  
✅ **Calendar** shows dots for all planned days  
✅ **Heavy haptic feedback** on successful goal creation  

### 6. Error Handling

- **Clear error messages** instead of endless loading
- **12-second timeout** maximum for any operation
- **Graceful fallback** to client planner when needed
- **Toast notifications** for success/failure

## Files Changed

- `lib/clientPlanner.ts` - Client-side planning logic
- `store/goalStore.ts` - Updated to use fallback system
- `.env` - Set API URL to trigger fallback mode
- `scripts/fix-tasks-completed-column-final.sql` - Database fix
- `scripts/fix-profiles-table-final.sql` - Profiles table fix

## Testing

After running the SQL scripts, try creating a goal with:
- **Title**: "Build muscle mass"
- **Description**: "I want to gain muscle mass"
- **Deadline**: 1 month from now

You should see tasks appear immediately on the Home screen and calendar dots for every day.
